**Generate repeatable, data-driven, publication quality figures of trees.**

In our current roadmap, the Tree Illustrator will be integrated with the main
[Open Tree](https://github.com/opentreeoflife) web apps and docstore, as well as the
[Arbor workflow tools](https://github.com/arborworkflows). This raises many
questions about:

* data visibility and access
* pre- and post-publication use cases
* incentives for participation in Open Tree

Early work has focused on a
[proof-of-concept](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/tree-illustrator/tree/master/stylist)
web application and on further discussion in the
[wiki](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/tree-illustrator/wiki). 

Tree Illustrator is a sub-project of the [Open Tree of Life](https://opentreeoflife.org/).
