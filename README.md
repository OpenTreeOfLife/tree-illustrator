**Generate repeatable, data-driven, publication quality figures of trees.**

In our current roadmap, the Tree Illustrator will be integrated with the main
[Open Tree](https://github.com/opentreeoflife) apps and docstore, as well as
[Arbor](https://github.com/arborworkflows) workflow tools. This raises many
questions about:

* data visibility and access
* pre- and post-publication use cases
* incentives for participation in Open Tree

Initial work is focused on a
[proof-of-concept](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/tree-illustrator/tree/master/stylist)
web application and on further discussion in the
[wiki](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/tree-illustrator/wiki). 

Our [simple project website](http://opentreeoflife.github.io/tree-illustrator/) is managed with GitHub Pages; by convention, its source can be found [in the `gh-pages` branch of this repository](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/tree-illustrator/tree/gh-pages).
